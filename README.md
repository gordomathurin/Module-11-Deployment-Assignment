# Module-11-Deployment-Assignment

Assignment Description

This assignment has 2 parts.

1) Write a client/server application with two parts, a server and a client. Have the client send the server a request to compute whether a number that the user provided is prime. The server responds with yes or no, then the client displays the answer.

View of Client-server application

Please see sample client/server application program for area of circle calculation as below:

2) Simulate deploying the above application to a user's computer. If you're really ambitious and want to show off, after you get the simple one working, add client/server functionality to your Word Occurrences application.
